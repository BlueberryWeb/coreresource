                    <p>
                        "Do Not Track (DNT) is a concept promoted by U.S. regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, for the Internet industry with the objective of developing and implementing a mechanism that allows Internet users to control the tracking or tracing of their online activities on different websites through the configuration of their browsers. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working for some time with industry players, Internet browsers, technology companies and standards bodies to develop a DNT technology standard. Although some progress has been made, it has been limited. To date, no standard has been adopted. As such <b class="mBold txt-azul">CINCO NOVENTA Y TRES CONSULTORES SA DE CV.</b> does not respond to "do not track" signals.
